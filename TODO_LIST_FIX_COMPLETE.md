# Todo List Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Summary
The initial planning "to do lists" feature didn't work in MarieCoder compared to cline-main because the `auto_todo` component was accidentally removed during refactoring.

## Root Cause
During MarieCoder's "KonMari-Tidied Structure" refactoring, the automatic todo list management component was removed, causing:
- ❌ No todo lists created when switching PLAN → ACT mode
- ❌ No periodic prompts (every 10 requests) to update todo lists
- ❌ AI unaware of automatic todo list management feature
- ❌ Initial planning checklists not working properly

## Files Changed

### Created
1. ✅ `/src/core/prompts/system-prompt/components/automatic_todo_management.ts`
   - New component providing automatic todo list management instructions
   - Self-explanatory filename following MarieCoder snake_case convention
   - Clean, well-documented implementation using `createComponent` pattern

### Modified
2. ✅ `/src/core/prompts/system-prompt/components/index.ts`
   - Added export for `automatic_todo_management` module
   - Added import for `getTodoListSection`
   - Registered `SystemPromptSection.TODO` in component array

### Already Existed
3. ✅ `/src/core/prompts/system-prompt/templates/section_definitions.ts`
   - `SystemPromptSection.TODO` enum already defined (line 8)
   - Already listed in `OPTIONAL_PLACEHOLDERS` (line 54)
   - No changes needed

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - No errors
```bash
npm run compile
# Checked 1054 files in 2s. No fixes applied.
# [watch] build finished
```

## What the Fix Does

The new `automatic_todo_management.ts` component instructs the AI to:

1. **Auto-prompt every 10 API requests** to review/update existing todo lists
2. **Create comprehensive todo list** when switching from PLAN MODE to ACT MODE
3. **Silent updates** using `task_progress` parameter (no user announcements)
4. **Standard Markdown checklist format**: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for completed
5. **Auto-inclusion** in prompts when appropriate
6. **Focus on actionable steps** rather than granular technical details

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Initial Task Planning
When user starts a new task:
```
User: "Create a new feature with login, dashboard, and settings"
AI: Creates todo list:
- [ ] Implement login authentication
- [ ] Build dashboard UI
- [ ] Create settings page
- [ ] Add navigation
- [ ] Test integration
```

### PLAN → ACT Mode Switch
When user switches from planning to implementation:
```
User: "Switch to ACT mode to implement the plan"
AI: Automatically creates comprehensive checklist and updates silently as work progresses
```

### Periodic Updates
Every 10th API request:
```
AI: (Silently updates todo list via task_progress parameter)
- [x] Implement login authentication
- [x] Build dashboard UI
- [ ] Create settings page  ← Currently working on
- [ ] Add navigation
- [ ] Test integration
```

## Testing Checklist

After deploying this fix:

- [ ] Start a new task in MarieCoder
- [ ] Ask for a complex multi-step task
- [ ] Verify AI creates initial todo list
- [ ] Switch from PLAN to ACT mode
- [ ] Confirm comprehensive checklist is created
- [ ] Observe todo list updates during task execution
- [ ] Check that updates are silent (via `task_progress` parameter)
- [ ] Verify periodic prompts every 10 requests

## Alignment with MarieCoder Philosophy

This fix embodies the KonMari approach:

### Observe
The TODO component was accidentally removed during "tidying from 13 → 10 files"

### Learn
- Essential features should not be removed just for reduction stats
- "Clarity improvement" shouldn't sacrifice functionality
- Auto todo management is critical for task tracking

### Evolve
- Restored with self-explanatory name: `automatic_todo_management.ts`
- Clean implementation using `createComponent` pattern
- Proper documentation explaining purpose

### Share
- Documented why it was missing
- Explained what it does
- Provided testing guidance

## Comparison with cline-main

### cline-main
- File: `auto_todo.ts`
- Less descriptive name
- Same functionality

### MarieCoder (Fixed)
- File: `automatic_todo_management.ts`
- More self-explanatory name
- Identical functionality
- Better documentation
- Follows snake_case convention

5. ⏳ Verify todo lists work correctly
6. ⏳ Commit changes with proper message
