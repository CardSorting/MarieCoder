## Contents

### Implementation Reports
- **WEB_WORKER_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md** - Comprehensive Web Worker implementation report
- **WEB_WORKER_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Detailed Web Worker improvements
- **WEB_WORKER_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of Web Worker enhancements
- **WEB_WORKER_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md** - Integration plan for Web Workers

### Specific Worker Implementations
- **HISTORY_SEARCH_WORKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - History search Web Worker implementation

## Web Worker Architecture

The documentation in this directory covers:

- **Markdown Worker** - Offloads markdown parsing and rendering to background thread
- **History Search Worker** - Handles history search indexing and querying
- **Worker Management** - Unified worker lifecycle and resource management
- **Performance Benefits** - How Web Workers improve UI responsiveness
- **Implementation Patterns** - Best practices for worker communication

## Key Benefits

1. **Main Thread Relief** - Offloads heavy computations from UI thread
2. **Improved Responsiveness** - UI remains interactive during intensive operations
3. **Better Performance** - Parallel processing for faster operations
4. **Resource Management** - Efficient worker pooling and lifecycle management
