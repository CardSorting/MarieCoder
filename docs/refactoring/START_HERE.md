# 🎉 Task Refactoring Complete - Start Here!

## Quick Summary

**Original Problem**: Diff edits failing on subsequent turns  
**What We Did**: Fixed bug + extracted 2 major services (786 lines)  
**Result**: Task class reduced by 19.7% + zero linter errors ✅

## ✅ What's Done

### 1. Diff Editing Bug - **FIXED** ✅
- Sequential diff edits to same file now work correctly
- `originalContent` always refreshed from disk
- No more stale content errors

### 2. TaskMessageService - **EXTRACTED** ✅  
- 348 lines of message handling logic
- Fully testable in isolation
- Location: `src/core/task/services/task_message_service.ts`

### 3. TaskContextBuilder - **EXTRACTED** ✅
- 438 lines of context building logic
- Fully testable in isolation  
- Location: `src/core/task/services/task_context_builder.ts`

### 4. Task Class - **REDUCED** ✅
- From: 2,612 lines → To: 2,097 lines
- Reduction: 515 lines (-19.7%)
- Quality: Zero errors, fully typed

## 🎯 What's Next (Optional)

### Remaining Services to Extract
1. **task_api_service.ts** (~977 lines) - Most complex, needs dedicated session
2. **task_lifecycle_service.ts** (~150 lines) - Start/abort/cleanup
3. **task_checkpoint_service.ts** (~200 lines) - Git operations
4. **task_state_sync.ts** (~100 lines) - State persistence

**Target**: Reduce Task class to ~300 lines (orchestrator only)  
**Progress**: 19.7% complete → 88% when done  
**Timeline**: 2-4 additional sessions (depending on pace)
