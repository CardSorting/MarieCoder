## 📋 Categorization Logic

### Root Level (docs/cli/)
**Purpose:** User-facing documentation that users need frequent access to

**Files:**
- `quick-reference.md` - Most important user document
- `getting-started.md` - First document new users need
- `testing-guide.md` - Testing procedures

**Rationale:** Keep the most accessed documents at the top level for easy discovery.

---

### Development Subdirectory (docs/cli/development/)
**Purpose:** Documentation for contributors and developers

**Files:**
- `feature-plan.md` - Roadmap and specifications
- `implementation-progress.md` - Current status
- `implementation-summary.md` - Overview
- `session-summary.md` - Historical notes
- `improvements/` - Improvement tracking documents

**Rationale:** Separate development concerns from user documentation.

---

### Features Subdirectory (docs/cli/features/)
**Purpose:** Feature-specific guides and documentation

**Files:**
- `clinerules-integration.md` - Clinerules feature
- `clinerules-summary.md` - Quick reference
- `custom-model-setup.md` - Model configuration
- `streamlined-setup.md` - Setup process

**Rationale:** Group feature documentation for easier maintenance and discovery.

    │   ├── getting-started.md
    │   ├── testing-guide.md
    │   ├── development/
    │   └── features/
    └── (extension documentation)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean root directory
