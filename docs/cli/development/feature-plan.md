## Technical Approach

### Design Principles
1. **Reuse Extension Code**: Leverage existing controllers and coordinators
2. **CLI-Native UX**: Adapt features for terminal interaction
3. **Non-Blocking**: Keep CLI responsive during long operations
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each feature is optional and independently useful
5. **Backwards Compatible**: New features don't break existing workflows

### Key Patterns
- **Coordinators**: Use existing coordinators for business logic
- **CLI Adapters**: Create CLI-specific adapters for user interaction
- **Event-Driven**: Subscribe to controller events for updates
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features work without full configuration

### Testing Strategy
- Test each feature independently
- Integration tests for feature combinations
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Performance testing for large projects

## Configuration Extensions

### New Configuration Keys
```typescript
interface EnhancedCliConfiguration {
  // Existing...
  
  // MCP
  mcpServers?: McpServerConfig[]
  mcpMarketplaceEnabled?: boolean
  
  // Plan/Act Mode
  planModeApiProvider?: string
  planModeApiModel?: string
  actModeApiProvider?: string
  actModeApiModel?: string
  currentMode?: "plan" | "act"

}
```
