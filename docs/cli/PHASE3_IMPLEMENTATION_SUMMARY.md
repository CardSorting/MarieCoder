# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

**MarieCoder CLI - Advanced Features**

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Version:** 1.3.0  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 3 brings advanced features to the MarieCoder CLI, completing the 11-feature roadmap. These features provide sophisticated task management, structured workflows, and Git-based version control for tasks.

---

## ✅ Implemented Features (3/3)

### 1. Checkpoints System ✓

**Implementation:** Git-based automatic checkpoint system  
**Files Created:**
- `src/cli/cli_checkpoint_integration.ts` - Integration layer with extension's checkpoint infrastructure

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Creation:** Checkpoints are created automatically on the first API request in a task
- **Shadow Git Repository:** Uses an isolated Git repository that doesn't interfere with user's main Git repo
- **Manual Creation:** Users can manually create checkpoints using `/checkpoint create`
- **Change Detection:** Check if there are new changes since last task completion
- **Status Monitoring:** View checkpoint system status and configuration

**How It Works:**
1. When a task starts and makes its first API request, a checkpoint is automatically created
2. The checkpoint uses the extension's `TaskCheckpointCoordinator` and `CheckpointTracker`
3. Changes are tracked in a shadow Git repository located in the global storage directory
4. Each workspace gets its own branch in the shadow Git for isolation
5. Checkpoints are Git commits with proper metadata

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
/checkpoint status    # Show checkpoint system status
/checkpoint create    # Create a manual checkpoint
/checkpoint changes   # Check for changes since last completion
```

**Architecture:**
- Integrates with existing `ICheckpointManager` interface
- Uses `buildCheckpointManager()` factory for single/multi-root workspaces
- Delegates to `Task.checkpointManager` for all operations
- Compatible with extension's checkpoint restoration UI

### 2. Focus Chain Support ✓

**Implementation:** Multi-step task progress tracking  
**Files Created:**
- `src/cli/cli_focus_chain_manager.ts` - Focus chain orchestration and display

**Key Features:**
- **Visual Progress:** Display structured multi-step tasks with progress indicators
- **Step Status Tracking:** Track each step as pending, in progress, completed, or skipped
- **Step Navigation:** Move to next step or skip current step
- **Duration Tracking:** Record time spent on each step
- **Compact Summary:** Quick view of current step in task execution

**Focus Chain Structure:**
```typescript
interface FocusChain {
  id: string
  taskId: string
  title: string
  steps: FocusChainStep[]
  currentStepIndex: number
  createdAt: number
  updatedAt: number
}

interface FocusChainStep {
  id: string
  description: string
  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "skipped"
  startTime?: number
  endTime?: number
  result?: string
}
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
/focus show     # Display current focus chain
/focus next     # Move to next step
/focus skip     # Skip current step
/focus clear    # Clear active focus chain
```

**Visual Display:**
```
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 Focus Chain: Implement User Authentication
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Step 1: Set up authentication backend [DONE]

- **Custom Workflows:** Create custom workflows specific to your projects
- **Variable Substitution:** Use `{{variable}}` placeholders in workflow prompts
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Execute multi-step task sequences automatically
- **Workspace-Specific:** Workflows stored in `.mariecoder/workflows/` directory

**Built-in Templates:**

1. **new-feature** - Standard feature implementation workflow
   - Plan Feature
   - Implement Core Logic
   - Add Tests
   - Update Documentation

2. **bug-fix** - Bug fixing workflow
   - Reproduce Bug
   - Fix Bug
   - Add Regression Test
   - Verify Fix

3. **refactor** - Code refactoring workflow
   - Analyze Code
   - Plan Refactoring
   - Refactor Code
   - Verify Tests Pass

**Workflow Structure:**
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  steps: WorkflowStep[]
  variables?: Record<string, string>
  createdAt: number
  updatedAt: number
}

interface WorkflowStep {
  name: string
  prompt: string
  autoApprove?: boolean
  variables?: Record<string, string>
}
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
/workflow list              # List available workflows
/workflow show <name>       # Show workflow details
/workflow run <name>        # Execute a workflow
/workflow delete <name>     # Delete a workflow
/workflow templates         # Create built-in template workflows
```

**Example Workflow:**
```json
{
  "name": "new-feature",
  "description": "Standard workflow for implementing a new feature",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Plan Feature",
      "prompt": "Plan the implementation of {{feature_name}}. Consider architecture, files to modify, and potential edge cases."
    },
    {
      "name": "Implement Core Logic",
      "prompt": "Implement the core logic for {{feature_name}}."
    }
  ],
  "variables": {
    "feature_name": "My Feature"
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
1. Create template workflows: `/workflow templates`
2. View available workflows: `/workflow list`
3. Execute a workflow: `/workflow run new-feature`
4. Customize variables when running workflows

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Reuse Extension Code:** Leverage existing infrastructure (e.g., CheckpointTracker)
2. **CLI-Native UX:** Adapt features for terminal interaction
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Each feature is optional and independently useful
4. **Backwards Compatible:** New features don't break existing workflows

### Integration Points

**Checkpoints:**
- Integrates with `Task.checkpointManager`
- Uses `ICheckpointManager` interface
- Delegates to `TaskCheckpointCoordinator`
- Compatible with extension's shadow Git system

**Focus Chains:**
- Stored in slash command context
- Can be created automatically by AI
- Provides visual feedback during task execution

**Workflows:**
- Stored in workspace `.mariecoder/workflows/`
- JSON format for easy editing
- Variable substitution at runtime
- Template library for common patterns

## 🎉 Conclusion

Phase 3 completes the MarieCoder CLI feature roadmap, bringing all 11 planned features to production. The CLI now has:

- ✅ **All Phase 1 features** (4/4): Core functionality
- ✅ **All Phase 2 features** (4/4): Enhanced UX
- ✅ **All Phase 3 features** (3/3): Advanced capabilities

The CLI is now feature-complete and production-ready, offering a powerful command-line alternative to the VS Code extension with sophisticated task management, version control, and workflow automation capabilities.

**Note:** Browser automation was intentionally excluded from CLI as it's more suitable for the GUI extension where visual interaction is available.

**Next Steps:**
- User feedback and refinement
- Performance optimization
- Additional workflow templates
- Enhanced browser automation
- Community-contributed features
