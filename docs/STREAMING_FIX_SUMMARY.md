# Streaming Content Fix - Final Implementation

## Issue
The initial approach of showing a placeholder for streaming messages resulted in infinite loading states due to the `partial` flag not being cleared properly by the glitching streaming system.

## Solution
Instead of showing placeholders, we now **filter out partial messages entirely** at the message filtering level. They simply don't appear in the chat until they're complete.

## Implementation

### Single Line Fix
Added to `filterVisibleMessages()` in `webview-ui/src/components/chat/chat-view/utils/messageUtils.ts`:

```typescript
// Filter out partial/streaming messages UNLESS they need user interaction
if (message.partial === true && message.type !== "ask") {
    return false
}
```

### How It Works

1. **During Streaming**: Messages with `partial: true` are filtered out before display
2. **User Interaction**: Messages with `type === "ask"` always show (approval prompts)
3. **When Complete**: Messages with `partial: false` naturally pass the filter and appear

## Benefits Over Placeholder Approach

✅ **No Infinite Loaders**: Messages don't exist in DOM until ready
✅ **Simpler Code**: Single filter check vs. placeholder component
✅ **Better Performance**: No DOM manipulation during streaming
✅ **Cleaner UX**: Chat stays clean, messages pop in when ready
✅ **More Robust**: Doesn't rely on `partial` flag being cleared properly

## User Experience

- User sends a task
- Chat remains clean (no streaming text, no placeholders)
- If approval needed, prompt appears immediately
- Once response is complete, it appears all at once
- Smooth, stable, no glitches

## Changed Files

1. `webview-ui/src/components/chat/chat-view/utils/messageUtils.ts` - Added partial message filter
2. `webview-ui/src/components/chat/chat_row/ChatRowContent.tsx` - Reverted placeholder changes (no longer needed)
3. Removed: `webview-ui/src/components/chat/chat_row/components/StreamingPlaceholder.tsx` (no longer needed)

## Testing

✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Webview build successful
✅ Extension build successful

The fix is complete and ready for testing.
