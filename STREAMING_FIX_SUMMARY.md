# Streaming Text Display Fix

## Problem
The streaming functionality was not working as intended - responses were only showing when complete instead of streaming incrementally. Users could see thinking/reasoning stream in real-time, but the actual text content would only appear after the entire response was received.

## Root Cause
The API stream manager (`api_stream_manager.ts`) was:
1. ✅ Properly streaming **reasoning/thinking** with `partial: true` messages
2. ❌ **NOT streaming text content** - it was only parsing and updating internal state
3. ❌ Text only appeared after `presentAssistantMessage()` completed processing

The key issue was in `parseAndPresentStreamingText()` method:
- It was parsing content and triggering presentation
- But it was **NOT sending partial message events** to the webview
- The webview subscription (`subscribeToPartialMessage`) was ready and working, but received no text updates

## Solution
Modified `/Users/bozoegg/Desktop/MarieCoder/src/core/task/services/api_stream_manager.ts`:

### 1. Added Partial Text Message Streaming (Line 316)
```typescript
private async parseAndPresentStreamingText(assistantMessage: string): Promise<void> {
    try {
        // Send partial text message to webview for streaming display
        // This ensures the UI updates in real-time as text streams in
        await this.messageService.say("text", assistantMessage, undefined, undefined, true)
        
        // ... rest of parsing and presentation logic
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated Stream Completion Logic (Lines 259-279)
```typescript
private async flushPendingUpdates(
    reasoningMessage: string,
    thinkingMessage: string,
    assistantMessage: string,
): Promise<void> {
    // ... reasoning flush logic
    
    if (assistantMessage) {
        // Send final text with partial=false to complete the streaming message
        await this.messageService.say("text", assistantMessage, undefined, undefined, false)
        
        // Parse and update task state for tool execution (without sending partial message)
        // ... parsing logic
    }
}
```

## How It Works

### During Streaming:
1. Text chunks arrive from API (`case "text"` at line 169)
2. Text is accumulated in `assistantMessage`
3. Every 50ms (throttled), `throttledTextUpdate()` is called
4. This calls `parseAndPresentStreamingText()`
5. **NEW:** Sends partial message via `messageService.say("text", ..., true)`
6. Webview receives via `subscribeToPartialMessage`
7. UI updates incrementally

### When Streaming Completes:
1. `flushPendingUpdates()` is called in `finally` block
2. **NEW:** Sends final text with `partial: false`
3. This finalizes the partial message
4. Parses content for tool execution
5. Triggers presentation logic

## Message Flow
```
API Stream Chunk
    ↓
accumulate in assistantMessage
    ↓
throttledTextUpdate (every 50ms)
    ↓
parseAndPresentStreamingText
    ↓
messageService.say("text", ..., partial: true)  ← NEW
    ↓
sendPartialMessageEvent
    ↓
webview subscribeToPartialMessage
    ↓
TaskStateContext updates clineMessages
    ↓
UI re-renders with new text
```

## Files Modified
- `/Users/bozoegg/Desktop/MarieCoder/src/core/task/services/api_stream_manager.ts`
  - `parseAndPresentStreamingText()` - Added partial message sending
  - `flushPendingUpdates()` - Added final message finalization

## Existing Infrastructure Leveraged
The fix leverages existing, well-tested infrastructure:
- ✅ `TaskMessageService.say()` - Already handles partial message logic
- ✅ `sendPartialMessageEvent()` - Already broadcasts to subscribers
- ✅ `subscribeToPartialMessage` - Already subscribed in webview
- ✅ `TaskStateContext` - Already updates messages on partial events
- ✅ Message throttling (50ms) - Already implemented

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start a new task with streaming enabled
- [ ] Verify text appears incrementally as it streams (not all at once)
- [ ] Verify reasoning/thinking still streams correctly
- [ ] Verify final message is complete and accurate
- [ ] Verify tool execution works after streaming completes
- [ ] Verify cancellation/abortion works correctly
- [ ] Check for any console errors

## Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Users see content ~50ms after it arrives (vs waiting for full response)
- **Neutral**: Uses existing throttling (50ms) to limit UI updates
- **Minimal overhead**: Reuses existing partial message infrastructure

## Backward Compatibility
✅ Fully backward compatible
- Uses existing `partial` parameter in `say()` method
- No changes to message structure or API
- No changes to webview subscription logic
- Falls back gracefully if webview not ready

## Notes
- Reasoning/thinking was already streaming correctly (line 279)
- The fix mirrors the existing reasoning streaming pattern
- Text streaming now works exactly like reasoning streaming
- No changes needed to webview code - it was already ready!
