## Testing Instructions

### Test Fix #1: Chat Streaming (2 minutes)
```
1. Open MarieCoder
2. Send any message that generates a response
3. Watch the chat area
4. Verify text streams smoothly character-by-character
5. ‚úÖ If smooth ‚Üí Fixed!
6. ‚ùå If chunky ‚Üí Report issue
```

### Test Fix #2: Todo Lists (3 minutes)
```
1. Start new task: "Create a complex authentication system"
2. Verify AI creates initial todo list
3. Switch to PLAN mode if not already
4. Ask for detailed planning
5. Switch to ACT mode
6. ‚úÖ If comprehensive checklist appears ‚Üí Fixed!
7. ‚ùå If no checklist ‚Üí Report issue
```

### Test Fix #3: Diff Editor (30 seconds + analysis)
```
1. Restart VS Code completely
2. Open Developer Tools Console (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Toggle Developer Tools")
3. Clear console (trash icon)
4. Send: "Create test.js with hello world"
5. **IMMEDIATELY copy ALL console logs**
6. Paste logs in response
7. I'll analyze and provide fix
```

## Critical: Diff Editor Test Required

The diff editor issue **cannot be fixed without your test results**. The code looks correct, but something is blocking the editor from opening. The debug logs will reveal exactly what.

### What the Logs Will Show

The console output will look like this:

```
[TaskApiService] presentAssistantMessage - Block type: tool_use, partial: true
[TaskApiService] üî• Calling toolExecutor.executeTool for write_to_file
[ToolExecutor] Executing tool: write_to_file, partial: true, path: test.js
[ToolExecutor] ‚úÖ Calling handlePartialBlock for write_to_file
[WriteToFileToolHandler] handlePartialBlock called for write_to_file, path: test.js
[WriteToFileToolHandler] validateAndPrepareFileOperation called - path: test.js, hasDiff: false, hasContent: true
[WriteToFileToolHandler] üî• Opening diff editor for /absolute/path/test.js
[VscodeDiffViewProvider] üî• openDiffEditor called for /absolute/path/test.js
[VscodeDiffViewProvider] Starting openDiffEditorWithRetry...
[VscodeDiffViewProvider] ‚úÖ Diff editor opened successfully
[WriteToFileToolHandler] ‚úÖ Diff editor opened successfully
[WriteToFileToolHandler] Content updated in diff editor
```

**The LAST log message you see** will tell me exactly where it's failing.

## Build Commands

### If You Need to Rebuild
```bash
cd /Users/bozoegg/Desktop/MarieCoder

# Full rebuild
npm run compile

# Quick build (extension only)
node esbuild.mjs

# Webview only
cd webview-ui && npm run build
```

### After Testing is Complete
```bash
# Remove debug logging (search for console.log with these prefixes):
- console.log(\`[ToolExecutor]
- console.log(\`[TaskApiService]
- console.log(\`[WriteToFileToolHandler]
- console.log(\`[VscodeDiffViewProvider]

# Keep error logging:
- console.error(\`[WriteToFileToolHandler]
```

## Summary Table

| Fix | Status | Test Required | ETA to Complete |
|-----|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Chat Streaming | ‚úÖ Complete | Manual verification | 2 min |
| Todo Lists | ‚úÖ Complete | Manual verification | 3 min |
| Diff Editor | üîç Instrumented | **Console analysis required** | 8 min |

## Priority Action

**HIGHEST PRIORITY**: Test diff editor and provide console output

This is the blocking item. Once you provide the console logs, I can:
1. Identify the exact failure point (1 minute)
2. Apply the targeted fix (5 minutes)
3. Remove debug logging (2 minutes)
4. Final testing (2 minutes)

**Total time to full resolution**: ~10 minutes after you provide logs

---

## Quick Start

Run this single test to unblock everything:

```
1. Restart VS Code
2. Open Developer Tools Console
3. Send to MarieCoder: "Create test.js with hello world"
4. Copy the console output
5. Paste it in a message to me
```

That's it! The logs have everything I need to fix it.
