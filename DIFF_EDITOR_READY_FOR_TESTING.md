# Diff Editor - Ready for Testing ‚úÖ

## Status: Debug Logging Complete, Build Successful

All code paths have been instrumented with comprehensive debug logging. The extension is ready for diagnostic testing.

## Build Status
‚úÖ **Success** - No errors
```
npm run compile
# [watch] build finished
```

## What Was Done

### Debug Logging Added to 5 Critical Files

1. **ToolExecutor.ts** (3 locations)
   - Tool execution entry point
   - Partial vs complete block routing
   - Shows which handler is called

2. **TaskApiService.ts** (2 locations)
   - Block presentation
   - Tool executor invocation

3. **WriteToFileToolHandler.ts** (8 locations)
   - handlePartialBlock entry and exit points
   - Parameter validation
   - Editor opening attempts
   - Content updates

4. **VscodeDiffViewProvider.ts** (3 locations)
   - Editor opening attempts
   - Success/failure status

5. **validateAndPrepareFileOperation** (1 location)
   - Validation entry point with parameters

### Code Comparison Result

**MarieCoder vs cline-main**: Nearly identical code ‚úÖ
- Same early return conditions
- Same validation logic
- Same editor opening logic
- Only difference: MarieCoder adds `autoFocus: true` (shouldn't break anything)

## How to Test (30 seconds)

### Quick Test
```
1. Restart VS Code completely
2. Open MarieCoder
3. Open Developer Tools (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Toggle Developer Tools")
4. Clear Console
5. Send: "Create test.js with hello world"
6. Watch console output
7. Copy ALL console logs
```

### What to Look For

The logs will show EXACTLY where the flow breaks. Look for the LAST log message that appears:

#### If Last Log Is:
- `[TaskApiService] presentAssistantMessage` ‚Üí Block not reaching ToolExecutor
- `[ToolExecutor] Executing tool` ‚Üí Check if `partial: true` or `false`
- `[ToolExecutor] Calling handleCompleteBlock` ‚Üí **Block wrongly marked complete!**
- `[WriteToFileToolHandler] Not enough data yet` ‚Üí **Early return triggered!**
- `[WriteToFileToolHandler] Validation failed` ‚Üí Validation returning null
- `[WriteToFileToolHandler] Opening diff editor` ‚Üí Editor opening attempt
- `[VscodeDiffViewProvider] openDiffEditor called` ‚Üí VSCode command executing
- `[VscodeDiffViewProvider] Diff editor opened successfully` ‚Üí **IT WORKS!** üéâ

## Likely Scenarios

### Scenario A: partial: false (Most Likely if Broken)
```
[ToolExecutor] Executing tool: write_to_file, partial: false  ‚Üê ‚ùå WRONG
[ToolExecutor] Calling handleCompleteBlock for write_to_file  ‚Üê Should be handlePartialBlock!
```
**Fix**: Parser not setting partial flag during streaming
**File**: `/src/core/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`

### Scenario B: Early Return (Possible)
```
[WriteToFileToolHandler] handlePartialBlock called
[WriteToFileToolHandler] Not enough data yet - path: true, content: false
```
**Fix**: Content parameter not extracted yet from XML
**File**: Parameter extraction in parser

### Scenario C: Validation Null (Possible)
```
[WriteToFileToolHandler] validateAndPrepareFileOperation called - path: test.js, hasDiff: false, hasContent: true
[WriteToFileToolHandler] Validation failed, skipping partial block
```
**Fix**: Add logging inside validateAndPrepareFileOperation to see why it returns null
**File**: `WriteToFileToolHandler.ts` line 353+

### Scenario D: It Actually Works! (20% chance)
```
[VscodeDiffViewProvider] ‚úÖ Diff editor opened successfully
```
**Action**: Remove debug logging and celebrate! üéâ

## Next Action Required

**YOU MUST TEST THIS** to get the console output. The logs will tell us exactly what's wrong.

### After Testing
1. Copy the full console output
2. Paste it into a message
3. I'll analyze it and apply the exact fix needed
4. We'll remove the debug logging
5. Done!

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't skip the test** - Without console output, we're guessing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Restart VS Code** - Ensure fresh extension load
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear console** - Make logs easier to read
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Copy ALL logs** - Full context is important

## Expected Timeline

- Test run: 30 seconds
- Copy logs: 10 seconds
- Analysis: 2 minutes
- Apply fix: 5 minutes
- Retest: 30 seconds
- **Total**: ~8 minutes to resolution

## Code is Ready

All debug logging is in place. The extension will tell us exactly what's happening when you test it.

**Next**: Run the 30-second test and report console output.
