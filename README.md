## What is this?

An AI coding assistant that works like you actually think. Chat with your codebase, ship features faster, and enjoy the process.

```
You: "Add dark mode to this app"
NormieDev: *analyzes your code, creates the files, updates the styles*
You: *clicks approve*
Done. That simple.
```

## Why NormieDev?

Because most AI coding tools are either:
- Too simple (glorified autocomplete)
- Too complex (enterprise feature bloat)
- Too opinionated (forces you into their workflow)

**NormieDev is different:**
- Powerful enough for production apps
- Simple enough to use immediately
- Flexible enough to work YOUR way

## Quick Start

1. Install in VS Code
2. Add your AI API key (or use free local models)
3. Open the chat and say what you want
4. Approve the changes you like
5. Ship it

No setup, no config files, no "getting started" tutorials to slog through.

## What Can It Do?

### Code
- Create new files and features
- Refactor existing code
- Fix bugs and errors
- Explain complex logic
- Update dependencies

### Run Things
- Execute terminal commands
- Start dev servers
- Run tests
- Install packages
- Deploy apps

### Test Things
- Launch browsers
- Click and test UI
- Capture screenshots
- Read console logs
- Find visual bugs

### Extend Itself
- Connect to databases via MCP
- Add custom tools
- Integrate APIs
- Create workflows

## Real Examples

**"Build a todo app with React and local storage"**  
‚Üí Creates components, adds state, handles persistence. 2 minutes.

**"This button isn't working, here's a screenshot"**  
‚Üí Analyzes the image, finds the issue, fixes it. Done.

**"Refactor this to TypeScript"**  
‚Üí Converts files, adds types, updates imports. Zero errors.

**"Add authentication with Supabase"**  
‚Üí Sets up auth flow, creates components, handles sessions. Works.

## Choose Your AI

Use whatever fits your needs:

| Provider | Best For | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Ollama** | Privacy, free usage | $0 |
| **Anthropic Claude** | Best quality | ~$3/hour |
| **OpenAI GPT** | Balanced | ~$1/hour |
| **OpenRouter** | 200+ models | Varies |
| **Gemini** | Fast & cheap | ~$0.50/hour |

Switch between them anytime. Use cheap models for simple tasks, powerful ones for complex work.

## Smart Context

Give NormieDev exactly what it needs:

```
@file src/app.js                    ‚Üí Include specific file
@folder components/                  ‚Üí Include entire folder
@url https://docs.stripe.com         ‚Üí Fetch and include docs
@problems                            ‚Üí Include all workspace errors
```

No more copy-pasting. No wasted tokens.

## You're In Control

Every action requires approval:
- ‚úÖ File changes ‚Üí See full diff before accepting
- ‚úÖ Terminal commands ‚Üí Review before running
- ‚úÖ Browser actions ‚Üí Approve each interaction

Don't like something? Give feedback and iterate.

## Checkpoints

NormieDev saves snapshots as it works:
- Compare any version to current state
- Restore to any previous point
- Experiment without fear
- Roll back instantly

Perfect for trying different approaches.

## Inspired by Cline

NormieDev is built on [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), an amazing open-source AI coding assistant. The Cline team's commitment to transparency and open development inspired us to create our own community-driven fork.

We're exploring additional features and workflows while maintaining the core excellence that makes Cline great. Massive respect to the Cline team for building such powerful tools and sharing them with the world.

## Getting Started

### Install
```
VS Code ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Search "NormieDev" ‚Üí Install
```

### Configure AI
Click the NormieDev icon ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Choose your AI provider ‚Üí Add API key

### Start Coding
Open NormieDev chat ‚Üí Type what you want ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Done

That's it. Seriously.

## Pro Tips

**Be direct:** "Add pagination" not "Can you maybe add pagination please?"

**Use context:** `@file` and `@folder` help NormieDev understand your project

**Iterate fast:** Quick feedback loops > perfect first try

**Trust the process:** Review changes but don't overthink

**Save money:** Use cheaper models for simple tasks

## FAQ

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: Extension is free. AI usage varies ($0-$3/hour depending on model).

**Q: Is my code private?**  
A: Cloud providers see your code. Use Ollama for 100% local/private.

**Q: What languages work?**  
A: All of them. JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, whatever.

**Q: Can it build complete apps?**  
A: Yes. Break big projects into focused tasks for best results.

**Q: How is this different from Copilot?**  
A: Copilot autocompletes. NormieDev builds, tests, debugs, and ships.

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: Helps if you do, but you'll learn fast by using it.
