## What is MarieCoder?

MarieCoder is a community fork of [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), the open-source AI coding assistant that's democratizing AI-assisted development. We're building on their incredible foundation to explore additional features and workflows that serve our community's needs.

**Part of the democratic development movement** - AI coding tools should be open, transparent, and controlled by users.

### Why "MarieCoder"?

Marie Curie broke barriers in science with curiosity and precision. MarieCoder brings that same spirit to coding - making powerful AI development accessible to everyone, regardless of experience level.

## What It Does

Chat with an AI that can:
- Create and edit files in your codebase
- Run terminal commands (with your approval)
- Browse and test your web apps
- Fix bugs with full context
- Extend itself with custom tools

Every action requires your approval. You're always in control.

## Quick Start

```bash
1. Install MarieCoder in VS Code
2. Add your AI API key
3. Start chatting about what you want to build
4. Review and approve changes
5. Ship it
```

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

The [Cline project](https://github.com/cline/cline) pioneered something revolutionary: proving that powerful AI coding assistants don't need to be proprietary black boxes. They can be:
- **Open source** - fully transparent codebase
- **User controlled** - you approve every action
- **Model agnostic** - use any AI provider you want
- **Community driven** - built with and for developers

MarieCoder carries forward this mission. We're not replacing Cline - we're contributing to the ecosystem they created. Both projects share the same core values and vision for democratic development.

**Huge respect to the Cline team** for making this possible. Their openness and commitment to user autonomy inspired us to build alongside them.

## Core Features

### üí¨ Smart Conversations
Talk to your codebase in natural language. MarieCoder understands context, patterns, and project structure.

### üìù File Operations
Create, edit, and refactor files. See diffs before accepting. Give feedback and iterate until it's right.

### ‚ö° Terminal Integration
Execute commands, install packages, run tests, start servers. MarieCoder monitors output and adapts as it works.

### üåê Browser Testing
Launch browsers, interact with your UI, capture screenshots, read console logs. Perfect for web development.

### üîå MCP Integration
Connect to databases, APIs, and external services using Model Context Protocol. Create custom tools for your workflow.

### üéØ Context Control
Use `@file`, `@folder`, `@url`, and `@problems` to give MarieCoder exactly what it needs.

### üì∏ Visual Development
Drop in screenshots or mockups. MarieCoder recreates them as working code.

### üíæ Checkpoints
Every step is saved. Compare versions, restore any previous state, experiment freely.

## Choose Your AI

MarieCoder works with any AI provider:

**Cloud Providers:**
- Anthropic Claude (high quality)
- OpenRouter (200+ models)

Switch between them anytime. Use what fits your budget and privacy needs.

## Real Examples

**"Build a React dashboard with charts"**
Creates components, adds visualization library, implements data flow. Fast.

**"This form validation isn't working"**
Analyzes the code, finds the logic error, fixes it, tests it. Done.

**"Refactor this to use async/await"**
Updates functions, handles errors properly, maintains behavior. Clean.

**"Add dark mode throughout the app"**
Updates styles, adds toggle, persists preference. Works everywhere.

## Context Tools

Give MarieCoder exactly what it needs:

```
@file src/components/Header.tsx    ‚Üí Include specific file
@folder src/utils/                  ‚Üí Include entire folder
@url https://api-docs.example.com   ‚Üí Fetch external docs
@problems                           ‚Üí Include all VS Code errors
```

Efficient and precise.

## How We Work

**User Control First**
Every file change, terminal command, and browser action requires approval. No surprises.

**See Everything**
Full diffs for file changes. Clear explanations for actions. Complete transparency.

**Iterate Freely**
Don't like something? Give feedback. MarieCoder adapts and tries again.

**Save Checkpoints**
Restore to any previous state. Experiment without risk.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```
VS Code ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Search "MarieCoder" ‚Üí Install
```

### Configuration
Click MarieCoder icon ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Choose AI provider ‚Üí Add API key

### Start Building
Open chat ‚Üí Describe what you want ‚Üí Review changes ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Done

## Tips for Success

**Be specific:** "Add pagination to the user table" beats "improve the UI"

**Use context:** `@file` and `@folder` help MarieCoder understand your project

**Iterate quickly:** Fast feedback loops get better results

**Break it down:** Smaller, focused tasks work best

**Mix models:** Use cheaper models for simple tasks, powerful ones for complex work

## Community

We're building together:

- üí¨ [Discord](https://discord.gg/VPxMugw2g9) - Daily discussions and support
- üêõ [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CardSorting/MarieCoder/issues) - Bug reports
- üí° [Discussions](https://github.com/CardSorting/MarieCoder/discussions) - Ideas and feedback
- ‚≠ê [Star the Project](https://github.com/CardSorting/MarieCoder) - Show support

Both MarieCoder and Cline communities welcome you. We're all building the future of democratic development together.

## FAQ

**How much does it cost?**
Extension is free. AI usage costs vary ($0 with Ollama to ~$3/hour with Claude Sonnet).

**Is my code private?**
Depends on AI provider. Cloud services process your code. Use Ollama for complete privacy.

**What can it build?**
Anything you can build in VS Code. Works with all languages and frameworks.

**How is this different from Copilot?**
Copilot autocompletes. MarieCoder plans, builds, tests, debugs, and iterates with you.

**Can I use both Cline and MarieCoder?**
Yes! Both are part of the same ecosystem. Try both and use what works for you.

**Why fork instead of contribute to Cline?**
We're exploring different features and approaches while maintaining the same core mission. Both projects benefit from diverse experimentation.
