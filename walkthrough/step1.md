# Start with a Goal, Not Just a Prompt

**Marie Coder is your AI coding partner** - not just a code completion tool.

## Think Bigger

Instead of asking for small code snippets, describe what you want to achieve:

- "Build a user authentication system with email verification"
- "Add a dashboard with charts showing monthly sales data"
- "Refactor this module to improve performance"

## Marie Coder Will:

1. **Plan** - Break down your goal into steps
2. **Ask** - Clarify requirements when needed
3. **Code** - Implement the solution with your approval
4. **Iterate** - Refine based on your feedback

## Example

```
You: "I need a contact form that sends emails"

Marie Coder:
- Creates form component with validation
- Sets up email service integration
- Adds error handling
- Tests the complete flow
- Shows you diffs for every change
```
