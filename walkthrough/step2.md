# Let Marie Coder Learn Your Codebase

**Context is everything.** The more Marie Coder knows about your project, the smarter the suggestions.

## Give Marie Coder Context

Use **@ mentions** to include specific files, folders, or information:

- `@file src/components/Header.tsx` - Include a specific file
- `@folder src/utils/` - Include an entire folder
- `@url https://api-docs.example.com` - Fetch external documentation
- `@problems` - Include all current VS Code errors and warnings

## Example

```
You: "Fix the authentication bug"
❌ Marie Coder doesn't know where to look

You: "Fix the authentication bug in @file src/auth/login.ts"
✅ Marie Coder reads the file, understands the context, and fixes it
```
