## 📊 Current Status

**Files Identified**: 7 large monolithic files  
**Files Completed**: 6 ✅  
**Files Remaining**: 1 ⏳  
**Total Lines Reduced**: 2,680 lines across 6 completed refactorings  
**Completion**: 86% (6 of 7 files)

### Quality Metrics (All Completed Refactorings)
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ 100% backward compatible
- ✅ All modules < 200 lines
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

## ⏳ Remaining Work

### 1. BrowserSessionRow.tsx 📋
**Status**: PLAN COMPLETED ✅ - Ready for implementation  
**Size**: 693 lines  
**Complexity**: High - React component with complex state management  
**Estimated Modules**: 7-8 focused components and hooks  
**Target Reduction**: 70-80% (693 → ~150 lines facade)  
**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

**Plan**: `/docs/refactoring/browser_session_row_refactoring_plan.md` (540 lines)

## 🙏 Philosophy

This refactoring effort honors all the developers who built MarieCoder. The "monolithic" files we're refactoring today were once elegant solutions that grew with the project's needs. We refactor not as criticism, but as evolution—carrying forward the wisdom these files taught us.

**Every line of code has a story. Every refactoring honors that story while writing the next chapter.**
