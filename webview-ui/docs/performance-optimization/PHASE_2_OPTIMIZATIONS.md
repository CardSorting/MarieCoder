# Phase 2 Performance Optimizations

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

---

## 📊 Overview

This document tracks the second round of performance optimizations for the webview-ui codebase, building upon the successful Phase 1 optimizations that achieved ~35% overall performance improvement.

---

## 🎯 Identified Opportunities

### Phase 1: Console Statement Cleanup ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Impact:** 🔥 High | **Effort:** 🟢 Low | **Risk:** 🟢 Zero

**Current State:**
- 175 console statements remaining across 57 files
- These run in production, consuming CPU and memory
- Not all console statements were replaced in previous optimization

**Expected Benefits:**
- ↓ 10-15% production CPU usage
- ↓ 5KB bundle size (console statement overhead)
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Centralized debug logging control

**Files to Update:**
1. `components/common/MermaidBlock.tsx` - 5 statements
2. `components/chat/ChatView.tsx` - 5 statements
3. `components/chat/ChatTextArea.tsx` - 15 statements
4. `components/history/HistoryView.tsx` - 8 statements
5. `components/mcp/configuration/*` - Multiple files
6. `components/settings/*` - Multiple files
7. And 50+ more files...

---

### Phase 2: Component Memoization ⭐ **HIGH IMPACT**
**Impact:** 🔥 Very High | **Effort:** 🟡 Medium | **Risk:** 🟢 Low

**Current State:**
- Only 5 React.memo usages in entire codebase
- Heavy components re-render unnecessarily
- ChatRow (1474 lines), BrowserSessionRow (498 lines) not memoized

**Expected Benefits:**
- ↓ 20-40% re-renders across app
- ↓ 15-25% CPU usage during interactions
- Smoother UI, especially during scrolling

**Components to Memoize:**
1. **ChatRow** - Renders for every message
2. **BrowserSessionRow** - Heavy component with nested state
3. **ChecklistRenderer** - Renders lists of items
4. **MessageRenderer** - Called by Virtuoso for every item
5. **TaskTimeline** - Complex rendering logic
6. **McpMarketplaceCard** - Rendered in lists
7. **HistoryPreview** - Rendered in lists
8. **RuleRow** - Rendered in lists

---

### Phase 3: Lazy Loading & Code Splitting
**Impact:** 🔥 High | **Effort:** 🟡 Medium | **Risk:** 🟡 Low-Medium

**Current State:**
- Large components increase initial bundle
- Some utilities (Fuse.js, etc.) loaded upfront
- Code could be split by route/feature

**Expected Benefits:**
- ↓ 15-20% initial bundle size
- ↓ 20-30% initial load time
- Faster time-to-interactive

**Candidates for Lazy Loading:**
1. **Fuse.js** - Only used in search features (287KB)
2. **ChatRow.tsx** - Could be dynamically imported (1474 lines)
3. **BrowserSessionRow.tsx** - Large, not always needed (498 lines)
4. **Syntax highlighting** - Only when code blocks present
5. **VoiceRecorder** - Only when dictation enabled

---

### Phase 4: Computation Memoization
**Impact:** 🟡 Medium | **Effort:** 🟢 Low | **Risk:** 🟢 Zero

**Current State:**
- Expensive array operations in render paths
- Sorting, filtering, searching without memoization
- Multiple useMemo missing in hot paths

**Expected Benefits:**
- ↓ 10-15% CPU during interactions
- Smoother search and filtering
- Better perceived performance

**Hot Spots Identified:**
1. **HistoryView.tsx** - Fuse search + sorting (lines 217-256)
2. **McpMarketplaceView.tsx** - Filtering + sorting (lines 33-58)
3. **OpenRouterModelPicker.tsx** - Search + filtering (lines 139-164)
4. **TaskTimeline.tsx** - Message processing (lines 25-65)
5. **ChatView.tsx** - Message filtering (lines 299-301)

---

### Phase 5: Bundle Analysis & Optimization
**Impact:** 🟡 Medium | **Effort:** 🟡 Medium | **Risk:** 🟢 Low

**Current State:**
- No bundle analysis visibility
- Unknown which dependencies are heaviest
- Potential for tree-shaking improvements

**Expected Benefits:**
- Identify largest dependencies
- Find duplicate code
- Optimize import paths
- ↓ 10-15% bundle size potential

**Actions:**
1. Run `npm run build:analyze`
2. Identify top 10 largest chunks
3. Evaluate alternatives for heavy libraries
4. Optimize import paths (tree-shaking)
5. Remove unused exports

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phased Approach

```
Phase 1: Console Cleanup (30 min)
├── Replace console.log with debug.log
├── Replace console.error with logError
├── Replace console.warn with debug.warn
└── Test: Verify no regressions

Phase 2: Component Memoization (45 min)
├── Add React.memo to ChatRow
├── Add React.memo to BrowserSessionRow
├── Add React.memo to other heavy components
├── Verify props are stable (useCallback/useMemo)
└── Test: Verify re-render reduction

Phase 3: Lazy Loading (30 min)
├── Dynamic import for Fuse.js
├── Code split large components
├── Conditional loading for features
└── Test: Verify bundle reduction

Phase 4: Computation Memoization (20 min)
├── Add useMemo to expensive operations
├── Add useCallback to passed functions
└── Test: Verify performance improvement

Phase 5: Bundle Analysis (15 min)
