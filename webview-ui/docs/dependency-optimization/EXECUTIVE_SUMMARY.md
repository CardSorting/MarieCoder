## 📊 Results

### Before → After

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Production Size | 481MB | ~317MB | **-164MB (-34%)** |
| Dependencies | 44 | 18 | **-26 (-59%)** |
| Packages | 1,068 | 450 | **-618 (-58%)** |
| Custom Code | 0 | 2,649 lines | **+2,649 lines** |

## ✅ What We Did

### Removed 26 Dependencies
- **7** completely unused packages
- **19** replaced with custom implementations or alternatives

### Created 2,649 Lines of Code
- 18 new utility and component files
- All TypeScript strict mode
- Comprehensive documentation
- Zero breaking changes

### Key Replacements
1. **lucide-react (41MB)** → 22 custom SVG icons (220 lines)
2. **react-remark ecosystem (3MB)** → marked.js (31KB) + custom plugins
3. **mermaid (65MB)** → Externalized to CDN with fallback
4. **@heroui/react (47MB)** → Custom components
5. **@floating-ui/react (1.5MB)** → Custom positioning
6. And 21 more...
