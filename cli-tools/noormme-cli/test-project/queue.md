Queue System Implementation - Project Handoff Document
Executive Summary

We're adding a robust job queue system to the Next.js application that handles background tasks efficiently and reliably. Think of it as a "task manager" for the app that organizes and executes work that doesn't need to happen immediately.
Start with:
1. p-queue for request-scoped operations (API calls, concurrent processing)
2. SQLite queue for background jobs that must persist

What Problem Are We Solving?
Current Challenges:

Slow user experience - Users have to wait for tasks like sending emails or processing images before getting a response
API rate limits - External services (OpenAI, Stripe, etc.) restrict how many requests we can make at once
Lost work - If the server restarts, any ongoing background work is lost
Resource overload - Too many tasks running simultaneously can crash the server

Our Solution:
A two-tier queue system that handles both quick tasks and long-running background jobs.

The Two-Tier Approach
Tier 1: In-Memory Queue (Fast Lane)
Purpose: Handle quick tasks that happen during a user request
Use Cases:

Rate-limiting API calls to prevent hitting service limits
Processing multiple uploaded images at once (but not too many)
Batch database operations
Controlling concurrent resource usage

Characteristics:

⚡ Very fast - no database overhead
🔄 Lost if server restarts (acceptable for quick tasks)
📊 Best for tasks that complete in seconds

Example: User uploads 10 images → Queue processes 3 at a time instead of all 10 simultaneously

Tier 2: Persistent Queue (Background Worker)
Purpose: Handle important tasks that must complete, even if server restarts
Use Cases:

Sending bulk emails (newsletters, notifications)
Generating reports that take minutes
Processing webhooks to external services
Scheduled/delayed tasks
Any critical operation that must not be lost

Characteristics:

💾 Saved to SQLite database - survives restarts
🔁 Automatic retry with intelligent backoff
⏰ Supports delays and scheduling
📈 Priority system for important jobs
🔍 Full visibility into job status

Example: Admin sends newsletter to 10,000 users → Jobs are queued and processed reliably in background, with retries if emails fail

What Gets Built
1. Database Structure
A new jobs table in SQLite that stores:

Job details (type, payload, priority)
Status tracking (pending, processing, completed, failed)
Retry information
Timestamps for monitoring

2. Queue Manager
Core system that:

Accepts new jobs from anywhere in the application
Processes jobs based on priority
Handles failures with automatic retries
Cleans up old completed jobs

3. Pre-Built Handlers
Ready-to-use handlers for common tasks:

Email Handler - Send transactional emails
Image Handler - Optimize and process images
Webhook Handler - Deliver webhooks to external services

4. Monitoring & Control
APIs to:

Check job status
View queue statistics
Cancel jobs
See what's currently running


Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

Set up database tables and migrations
Build core queue infrastructure
Implement basic job handlers
Add initialization on server startup

Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)

Replace existing blocking operations with queued jobs
Add monitoring endpoints
Test retry and failure scenarios
Document usage for development team

Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)

Fine-tune concurrency settings
Add custom handlers for specific business needs
Set up automated cleanup
Performance testing under load


Benefits
For Users:

✨ Faster response times - No waiting for background tasks
🎯 Better reliability - Jobs don't fail silently
📧 Guaranteed delivery - Emails and notifications always sent

For Developers:

🛠️ Simple API - Easy to queue new types of jobs
🔍 Full visibility - See exactly what's happening
🧪 Testable - Can verify jobs without running them
📚 Type-safe - TypeScript ensures correctness

For Operations:

📊 Monitoring - Track queue health and performance
🔧 Control - Pause, resume, or cancel jobs as needed
🧹 Self-cleaning - Old jobs automatically removed
💪 Scalable - Easy to upgrade to Redis/BullMQ later if needed


Example Use Cases in Our App
1. Newsletter Campaign
Before: Admin clicks "Send Newsletter" → Server tries to send 10,000 emails → Times out or crashes
After: Admin clicks "Send Newsletter" → 10,000 jobs queued instantly → Returns success → Emails sent in background with retries

2. User Uploads Images
Before: User uploads 20 images → Server processes all at once → High memory usage, slow response
After: User uploads 20 images → Queue processes 3 at a time → Fast response, controlled resource usage

3. API Integration
Before: Making 100 OpenAI API calls → Hit rate limit → Some calls fail
After: Queue ensures only 10 calls per minute → All calls succeed → Stays within rate limits

Migration Path
Immediate (No Changes Required):

Existing functionality continues to work
No breaking changes to current codebase

Gradual Adoption:

Start using in-memory queues for new features
Migrate existing blocking operations one at a time
Add persistent queue for critical operations
Eventually replace all synchronous heavy operations
