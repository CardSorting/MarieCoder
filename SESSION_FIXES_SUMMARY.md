# MarieCoder Fixes Summary

This session identified and fixed **two critical issues** in MarieCoder compared to cline-main.

---

## Fix #1: Chat Response Streaming ‚úÖ

### Problem
Chat responses were broken and malformed - streaming updates were throttled/batched instead of appearing in real-time.

### Root Cause
`MessageRenderer.tsx` had aggressive `React.memo` optimization with time-based batching logic (22ms intervals) that prevented streaming messages from updating smoothly.

### Solution
Removed memoization and batching logic from `MessageRenderer.tsx` to match cline-main's simple functional component pattern.

### Files Changed
- `/webview-ui/src/components/chat/chat-view/components/messages/MessageRenderer.tsx`

### Build Status
‚úÖ Successful - `webview-ui` built in 7.30s

### Documentation
- `/CHAT_STREAM_FIX.md` - Technical details
- `/STREAMING_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Testing procedures

---

## Fix #2: Todo List Initial Planning ‚úÖ

### Problem
Initial planning "to do lists" feature didn't work - AI didn't create checklists when planning tasks.

### Root Cause
The `auto_todo` component was accidentally removed during MarieCoder's "KonMari tidying" refactoring (13 ‚Üí 10 files reduction).

### Solution
Created missing `automatic_todo_management.ts` component and registered it in the system prompt component array.

### Files Changed
1. **Created**: `/src/core/prompts/system-prompt/components/automatic_todo_management.ts`
2. **Modified**: `/src/core/prompts/system-prompt/components/index.ts`

### Build Status
‚úÖ Successful - Checked 1054 files, no errors

### What It Does
- Auto-prompts every 10 API requests to update todo lists
- Creates comprehensive checklist when switching PLAN ‚Üí ACT mode
- Silent updates via `task_progress` parameter
- Standard Markdown checklist format
- Auto-included in prompts when appropriate

### Documentation
- `/TODO_LIST_FEATURE_MISSING.md` - Investigation details
- `/TODO_LIST_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Fix summary

---

## Fix #3: Diff Editor Investigation (Documented)

### Problem
Diff edits appear only in chat instead of opening in VS Code editor.

### Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **Documented, not yet fixed**

### Investigation
Created comprehensive investigation document with:
- Complete flow analysis
- Potential root causes
- Debug logging instructions
- Testing procedures
- Quick fix suggestions

### Most Likely Cause
`block.partial` flag not being set correctly during streaming, causing `handlePartialBlock()` to never be called.

### Documentation
- `/DIFF_EDITOR_INVESTIGATION.md` - Complete investigation guide

## Commit Messages

### Chat Streaming Fix
```
fix(chat): restore real-time streaming for chat responses

Remove aggressive memoization from MessageRenderer that was throttling
streaming updates. Reverted to legacy pattern for immediate rendering.

- Removed React.memo batching logic from MessageRenderer
- Removed time-based throttling (MIN_RENDER_INTERVAL_MS)
- Removed content delta checks (MIN_TEXT_DELTA, MIN_REASONING_DELTA)
- Now matches working cline-main pattern exactly

Fixes: broken/malformed chat response stream
```

### Todo List Fix
```
fix(prompts): restore automatic todo list management component

The automatic todo list management component was accidentally removed during
the "KonMari tidying" refactoring. This component is essential for:
- Creating todo lists when switching PLAN ‚Üí ACT mode
- Prompting updates every 10 API requests
- Tracking task progress with checklists

Changes:
- Created automatic_todo_management.ts component
- Registered SystemPromptSection.TODO in component array
- Used self-explanatory filename following snake_case convention

Fixes: Missing initial planning todo lists
Restores: Automatic todo list management feature from cline-main
```

## Philosophy Alignment

Both fixes align with MarieCoder's KonMari methodology:

### Chat Streaming Fix
- **Observed**: Aggressive optimization serving performance goals
- **Learned**: Over-optimization harms user experience
- **Evolved**: Reverted to simpler, more reliable pattern
- **Lesson**: Premature optimization is the root of all evil

### Todo List Fix
- **Observed**: Component removed during tidying
- **Learned**: Essential features shouldn't be removed for reduction stats
- **Evolved**: Restored with better, self-explanatory naming
- **Lesson**: "Clarity improvement" shouldn't sacrifice functionality

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test in live environment**
   - Verify chat streaming works smoothly
   - Confirm todo lists appear in initial planning
   - Check PLAN ‚Üí ACT mode transition

2. **Fix diff editor issue** (if still present)
   - Follow investigation guide in `/DIFF_EDITOR_INVESTIGATION.md`
   - Add debug logging
   - Identify where partial flag is lost

3. **Commit changes**
   - Use provided commit messages
   - Reference issue numbers if applicable
   - Update CHANGELOG if needed
